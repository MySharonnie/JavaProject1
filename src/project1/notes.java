    /* question 1
    1. create a 1d array with 7 temps; data type - int
    2. need to check each value 1 by 1 with the loop
    3. create variable highest and set it at the first index in array so we can compare it with the other numbers in the if condition.
    if you need to compare values, start with index 0; do not assume any values
    4. for (int i = 0; i<array.length; i++) then input if conditions

    question 2
    1. create an array with int values
    2. create variable sum; sum=sum+n (the next element in the array); set sum to 0 initially because 0+ anything equals the new sum
    3. enhanced for loop (int n: array) - n is the variable for each element

    question 3
    1. 2d array of int types storing odd & even numbers; print even numbers only
    2. nested loops; 1 for rows and 1 for columns * don't hard code array lenghth. use array.length in loops
    3. array.length tells java how many 1d arrays are in the program
    4. create a name for each 1d array; array [] [] = element in the array; array[] - full 1d array
    outer loop represents iterations going through the rows; inner loops represent iteration going through each element of the rows (col)

    question 4 - sum of even and sum of odd #'s -
    1. find the sum of even then find the sum of odd to separate out the code
    2. define variable for off sum and even sum; use if else condition to separate out even and odd

    question 5 - swap 2 numbers without a temp variable
    1. use arithmetic operators to make the variables change values

    question 6
    1. declare int & boolean variable
    2. for loop don't start at 0 or 1; 0 gets an error and 1 only has 1 number to divide by itself
    3. if any answer in the loops has a remainder that = 0; then the number is not prime

    question 7 - fibonacci sequence
    1. 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 24
    2. variable for how many  numbers to generate (loop limit)
    3. int for first & second number since the sequence involves adding the previous 2 numbers
    4. code needs to move forward making the 2nd number first & next number second; after adding; need to have second = first & next = second

    question 8 = see #1

    question 9
    1. use array and loop from 1
    2. need variable for 2nd largest - set at index 0
    3. temps[1]> largest; second largest = largest; else  temp[1]secondlargest && temp[1] != largest , ifsecondlargest=tem[i]

question 10
1. nested loop - outer defines which element is the basis of comparison; inner loops choose the other elements to compare to the first= inner loops starts at i+1
